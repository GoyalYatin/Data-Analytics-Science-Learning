    "The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.\n",

    "http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/SoftmaxRegression/\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to assign probabilities to an object being one of several different things, softmax is the thing to do, because softmax gives us a list of values between 0 and 1 that add up to 1.\n",
    "A softmax regression has two steps: first we add up the evidence of our input being in certain classes, and then we convert that evidence into probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tally up the evidence that a given image is in a particular class, we do a weighted sum of the pixel intensities. The weight is negative if that pixel having a high intensity is evidence against the image being in that class, and positive if it is evidence in favor.\n",

    "\n",
    "One very common, very nice function to determine the loss of a model is called \"cross-entropy.\" Cross-entropy arises from thinking about information compressing codes in information theory but it winds up being an important idea in lots of areas, from gambling to machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-entropy is measuring how inefficient our predictions are for describing the truth. \n",
